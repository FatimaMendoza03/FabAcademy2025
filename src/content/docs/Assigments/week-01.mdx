## Git tutorial

First I had to check if is it installed already? 
So I checked it in the terminal as shown in the following image.

![terminal with commands](./week-01/git-installed.png)

So it wasn't installed yet so I download it from the internet.

![program download](./week-01/download.png)

After I checked it again in the terminal. 

![program download](./week-01/already-installed.png)

I installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) from the internet. Then I initialized git repository in my folder with the following command:

```
git init 
```
After I created a repository in GitHub named FabAcademy2025
![program download](./week-01/git-repository.png)

It didn't work at the beginning
![program download](./week-01/fail.png)

So fixed it with the following in the terminal

```
git config --global user.name "FÃ¡tima Mendoza"
git config --global user.email fatimaliliana.mendoza2003@gmail.com
```

## Changing Static Site Generator

Going from Mkdocs to Astro ðŸš€

- install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es)

open `cmd`, and get the template [CelestialDocs](https://astro.build/themes/details/celestialdocs/) using [astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#use-a-theme-or-starter-template), run:
```
npm create astro@latest -- --template HYP3R00T/CelestialDocs
