title: Week 4 - Embedded Programming
---

For this week the assignment is:
- Browse through the datasheet for your microcontroller
- Write a program for a microcontroller, and simulate its operation, to interact (with local input &/or output devices) and communicate (with remote wired or wireless connection)

## Interesting info of XIAO ESP32S3

ESP32-S3 is a dual-core XTensa LX7 MCU, capable of running at 240 MHz. Apart from its 512 KB of internal SRAM, it also comes with integrated 2.4 GHz, 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 (LE) connectivity that provides long-range support. It has 45 programmable GPIOs and supports a rich set of peripherals. ESP32-S3 supports larger, high-speed octal SPI flash, and PSRAM with configurable data and instruction cache.

ESP32-S3 is a low-power MCU-based system on a chip (SoC) with integrated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth®
Low Energy (Bluetooth LE). It consists of high-performance dual-core microprocessor (Xtensa® 32-bit LX7), a
ULP coprocessor, a Wi-Fi baseband, a Bluetooth LE baseband, RF module, and numerous peripherals.

With low power consumption, ESP32-S3 is an ideal choice for IoT devices in the following areas:
- Smart Home
- Industrial Automation
- Health Care
- Consumer Electronics
- Smart Agriculture
- POS machines
- Service robot
- Audio Devices
- Generic Low-power IoT Sensor Hubs
- Generic Low-power IoT Data Loggers
- Cameras for Video Streaming
- USB Devices
- Speech Recognition
- Image Recognition
- Wi-Fi + Bluetooth Networking Card
- Touch and Proximity Sensing

The pin layout is the following, it's important to know this so we can use it correctly

I found the information in this [web page](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3) and then I look for the [data sheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_datasheet_en.pdf) so I could check it and be aware of how the microcontroller works.

## Simulation

For the simulation process I'm using [WOKWI](https://wokwi.com/). It's a really interesting website, it has a lot of microcontrollers that we can work with, they also already have some connections made and you can use them. 
I found the micocrontroller that I'm using and they already have a [simulation](https://wokwi.com/projects/411276781876475905) with LEDs. They also have code already made so I will be using that one as a base and changing it as I need it. 

## Programming Process

For the code I'm using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) which I already have installed in my computer but you can download it [here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)

First I open the program 

Then I created a new file
